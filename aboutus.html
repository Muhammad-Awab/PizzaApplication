      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as a culinary icon par excellence in Hong
        Kong. With its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys patronage from the
        A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of the best three-star Michelin chefs in the world, you never know

      <p>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <em>The Frying Pan</em>, a successful chain started by our CEO,
        Mr. Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.</p>
